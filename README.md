# Molesweeper Game

Molesweeper is a Minesweeper-like game I built in JavaScript during my second week of JavaScript Bootcamp. It is loosely adapted from a command-line-based minesweeper clone I wrote using Python two months earlier. The art was created using Dall-E.

The newest version of the code exchanges the original code's reliance on imperative programing for a modular, object-oriented approach to improve readability.
